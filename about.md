I am an economist turned energy forecaster, banker, digital analytics consultant, open source developer and data scientist/engineer. I'm predominantly a user of open-source technologies (R, Python, Julia, MySQL, Postgres, Hadoop) and a heavy Amazon Web Services user (Redshift, DynamoDB, EC2, S3).

## A note about technologies used on this website (my pseudo-privacy policy)

Any number of web measurement and optimization tools may be installed on this blog at any given time as I look to keep up with the technology of the Internet.

If this type of tracking makes you uncomfortable, note that I have no way of knowing anything about you, as there are no requirements to input PII data on this website

But, if any of this still makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to browse using FireFox or Chrome Private Browsing, AdBlock or similar plugins...really, whatever makes you feel comfortable consuming the content here.

Enjoy!
