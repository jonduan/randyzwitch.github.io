In a previous post, I discussed how to [remove &#8220;Powered By WordPress&#8221;](http://randyzwitch.com/removing-powered-by-wordpress-scrappy/ "Remove Powered By WordPress Scrappy theme") from the footer of the Scrappy theme.Â  You might also want to add a &#8220;Back to Top&#8221; link in the footer, especially if your blog has a lot of vertical distance from the top to the bottom.Â  Here&#8217;s how to do it&#8230;

## Step 1:Â  Modifying the Scrappy header.php file

The first step in creating our &#8216;Back to Top&#8217; link is to modify the _header.php_ file in our <a title="WordPress Child Theme" href="http://randyzwitch.com/twenty-eleven-child-theme-creating-css-file/" target="_blank">WordPress child theme</a> by adding an <a title="HTML anchor tag" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">empty HTML link</a> using the &#8220;<a>&#8221; tag.Â  Although you can place an &#8220;anchor&#8221; like this anywhere you want on your site, we&#8217;ll add this empty link to the very top of the page for this tutorial.

Find the line of code in your _header.php_ file that says &#8216;<div id=page class=&#8221;hfeed site&#8221;>&#8217;.Â  Here we&#8217;ll add our extra line of code with the <a> tag (line 5 of the pastebin):

Normally when using an <a> tag, we would also use an &#8220;href&#8221; in order to create a link.Â  However, in this case we&#8217;re just defining an empty element in the page that we can refer to later using our &#8216;Back to Top&#8217; link.
  

  


## Step 2: Modifying the Scrappy footer.php file

With our anchor in place, we can now add our link.Â  For this tutorial, we&#8217;re going to place the link right above the widget area in the Scrappy footer. 

Opening up our _footer.php_ file, we need to look for the code &#8220;<div class = &#8220;footer-sidebars&#8221;>&#8217;.Â  Underneath this line, we&#8217;ll add another <a> tag, but this time, we&#8217;ll add an &#8220;href&#8221; tag in order to have a link to send the page back to the top (line 6 of the pastebin):

Notice that the link we have here uses the same &#8220;TopOfPage&#8221; reference as we did in Step 1, this time with a # sign in front of the word. This lets the page code that we want to point to the &#8220;TopOfPage&#8221; anchor elsewhere on site. Note also that we don&#8217;t need to make any domain-specific references like we would do with a &#8220;normal&#8221; http://www.-type of link.

Obviously, feel free to change the reference to &#8220;Your Text Goes Here&#8221; to be whatever message you&#8217;d like the link to say ðŸ™‚

## Success!

Once you are done with these two changes, the bottom of your Scrappy WordPress theme should look similar to this:

<div id="attachment_1404" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class=" wp-image-1404 " title="scrappy-wordpress-theme-back-to-top" src="http://i0.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scrappy-wordpress-theme-back-to-top.png?resize=544%2C70" alt="" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scrappy-wordpress-theme-back-to-top.png?w=907 907w, http://i0.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scrappy-wordpress-theme-back-to-top.png?resize=150%2C19 150w, http://i0.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scrappy-wordpress-theme-back-to-top.png?resize=300%2C38 300w, http://i0.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/scrappy-wordpress-theme-back-to-top.png?resize=500%2C63 500w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    &#8216;Back to Top&#8217; link added to the bottom of the Scrappy WordPress theme
  </p>
</div>

The styling of the link should be right-aligned to your main article width and the link styling will be handled automatically based on the rules set in your CSS file.
