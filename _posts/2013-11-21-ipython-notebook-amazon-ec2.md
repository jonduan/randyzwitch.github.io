Last week, I wrote a guest blog post at <a title="Guest post at Bad Hessian" href="http://badhessian.org/2013/11/cluster-computing-for-027hr-using-amazon-ec2-and-ipython-notebook/" target="_blank">Bad Hessian</a> about how to use IPython Notebook along with Amazon EC2 as your data science & analytics platform. I won&#8217;t reproduce the whole article here, but if you are interested in step-by-step instruction on how to setup an Amazon EC2 instance to use IPython Notebook, see the SlideShare presentation below which outlines the steps needed to setup a remote IPython Notebook environment (or, <a title="amazon-ec2-ipython-installation PDF" href="http://randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cluster-computing-ipython-ec2.pdf" target="_blank">PDF download</a>).



If you already have experience setting up EC2 images and just need the IPython Notebook settings, here are the commands that are needed to set up your IPython public notebook server.Happy IPython Notebooking!
