I did a screencast for my co-workers to show how to get started with R, specifically what a base installation of R looks like, then showing how to improve your workflow using RStudio, Rcmdr or rattle.Â  The examples are somewhat pedestrian, but it gives a feel for what using R actually looks like.

If you have any questions, comments, or jeers about how bad I am at R, feel free to leave a comment in the comments section!
