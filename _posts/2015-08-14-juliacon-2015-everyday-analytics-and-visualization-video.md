At long last, here&#8217;s the video of my presentation from JuliaCon 2015, discussion common analytics tasks and visualization. This is really two talks, the first being an example of using the citibike NYC API to analyze ridership of their public bike program, and the second a discussion of the Vega.jl package.

Speaking at JuliaCon 2015 at MIT CSAIL is the professional highlight of my year; hopefully even more of you will attend next year.

Enjoy!
