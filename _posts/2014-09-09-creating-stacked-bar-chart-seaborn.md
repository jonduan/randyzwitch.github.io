The other day I was having a heck of a time trying to figure out how to make a stacked bar chart in Seaborn. But in true open-source/community fashion, I ended up getting a response from the creator of Seaborn via Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-conversation="none">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/randyzwitch">@randyzwitch</a> I don&#8217;t really like stacked bar charts, I&#8217;d suggest maybe using pointplot / factorplot with kind=point
  </p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

So there you go. I don&#8217;t want to put words in Michael&#8217;s mouth, but if he&#8217;s not a fan, then it sounded like it was up to me to find my own solution if I wanted a stacked bar chart. I hacked around on the <a title="pandas visualization" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html" target="_blank">pandas plotting functionality</a> a while, went to the <a title="matplotlib stacked bar chart" href="http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/examples/pylab_examples/bar_stacked.html" target="_blank">matplotlib documentation/example for a stacked bar chart</a>, tried Seaborn some more and then it hit me&#8230;I&#8217;ve gotten so used to these amazing open-source packages that my brain has atrophied! Creating a stacked bar chart is SIMPLE, even in Seaborn (and even if Michael doesn&#8217;t like them ðŸ™‚ )



## Stacked Bar Chart = Sum of Two Series

In trying so hard to create a stacked bar chart, I neglected the most obvious part. Given two series of data, Series 1 (&#8220;bottom&#8221;) and Series 2 (&#8220;top&#8221;), to create a stacked bar chart you just need to create:

<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">Series 3 = Series 1 + Series 2</pre>

Once you have Series 3 (&#8220;total&#8221;), then you can use the overlay feature of matplotlib and Seaborn in order to create your stacked bar chart. Plot &#8220;total&#8221; first, which will become the base layer of the chart. Because the total by definition will be greater-than-or-equal-to the &#8220;bottom&#8221; series, once you overlay the &#8220;bottom&#8221; seriesÂ on top of the &#8220;total&#8221;Â series, the &#8220;top&#8221; series will now be stacked on top:

#### Background: &#8220;Total&#8221; Series

#### Overlay: &#8220;Bottom&#8221; Series

## End Result: Stacked Bar Chart

Running the code in the same IPython Notebook cell results in the following chart (<a title="chart-data" href="http://randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked_bar.csv" target="_blank">download chartÂ data</a>): [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3041" src="http://i2.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked-bar-seaborn.png?fit=1395%2C621" alt="stacked-bar-seaborn" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked-bar-seaborn.png?w=1395 1395w, http://i2.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked-bar-seaborn.png?resize=150%2C66 150w, http://i2.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked-bar-seaborn.png?resize=300%2C133 300w, http://i2.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked-bar-seaborn.png?resize=1024%2C455 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://i2.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stacked-bar-seaborn.png)

## Don&#8217;t Overthink Things!

In the end, creating a stacked bar chart in Seaborn took me 4 hours to mess around trying everything under the sun, then 15 minutes once I remembered what a stacked bar chart actually represents. Hopefully this will save someone else from my same misery.
