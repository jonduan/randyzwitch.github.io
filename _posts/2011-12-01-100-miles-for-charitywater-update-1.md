    Donations come in spurts, but the running continues!

About halfway into my charity:water campaign (<a title="100 miles for charity:water" href="http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater" target="_blank">donate here</a>), I'm pleased to say that I've raised $675!Â  Translated into miles, that's 67.5 miles, of which I've run 37.95 thus far.





The running is starting to get easier, but I'm starting to lose momentum on the donations side.Â  I've thoroughly worked the Facebook Friends network, and with a little "Embarrass Randy" motivation, my co-workers have put up quite a bit of money.Â  It's funny how offering to run on the company treadmill on my normal work-from-home day can get people to cough up the dough.Â  That, and the fact that they can drink beer and mock me during said running...

But with those two personal networks tapped out, I'm going to have to start twisting arms pretty soon.Â  Unless there are some [charitable readers](http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater "100 miles for charity:water") out there ðŸ™‚
