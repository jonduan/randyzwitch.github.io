When the iPhone 4S was announced on October 4th, there was much gnashing of teeth by Apple fanboys and stock market <a title="Yahoo Finance Apple 4S" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/breakout/apple-iphone-4s-opens-door-competitors-analyst-210516885.html" target="_blank">analysts</a> about how this &#8220;lackluster&#8221; iPhone refresh was going to allow competitors to overtake Apple. That without a re-designed case and bigger screen and more storage and&#8230;and&#8230;and. All of the rumors (and the subsequent disappointment) ignored one of the simple economic realities of the cell phone market:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>When buyers are locked in a two-year upgrade cycle, you don&#8217;t need to change the product landscape with every model.</em>
</p>

So if you&#8217;re like me and using an iPhone 3GS (or older!), the iPhone 4S should definitely be a worthy upgrade.

## iPhone 4S Hardware: Many Improvements over the iPhone 3GS

One of the biggest reasons I&#8217;ve been looking to upgrade from the iPhone 3GS is that my phone has just started acting &#8220;tired&#8221; in the last 6-9 months.  When I purchased the 3GS, that was before iOS4 and iOS5, and with each iOS update I&#8217;m sure the processor usage has increased.  Skipping the iPhone 4 and waiting for the 4S, that&#8217;s two processor upgrades compared to my current phone, which I&#8217;m sure will make the phone feel that much speedier.

But it&#8217;s not just the processor here that&#8217;s a huge improvement&#8230;moving to the 4S gives a better camera with flash, front-facing camera to use with FaceTime, the Retina display for improved screen clarity, longer battery life, and 1080P video capturing.  I opted to purchase the white iPhone 4S (which doesn&#8217;t provide any additional functionality!) and upgraded to the 32GB storage instead of 16GB on my 3GS.

I think it&#8217;s safe to say that even without a case re-design, the iPhone 4S is in a different world hardware-wise than my current 3GS.





## iPhone 4S Activation Issues

At this point, you&#8217;re probably expecting that I would cover how the iOS5 software is working on said hardware upgrade.  But if you&#8217;ve been following any of the major tech blogs like <a title="CNET iPhone 4S story" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20120568-17/iphone-4s-buyers-complain-of-at-t-activation-issues/?tag=mncol" target="_blank">CNET</a>, you see that there are widespread reports of users being unable to activate their iPhone 4S&#8217;s.  At first, I thought it was just AT&T&#8217;s generally poor service and network, but <a title="InformationWeek iPhone 4S" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/smart_phones/231900844" target="_blank">InformationWeek</a> is reporting that all carriers are experiencing this phenomenon.  There may have been gnashing of teeth during the iPhone 4S announcement, but with Apple&#8217;s <a title="Apple sells out iPhone 4S pre-sale" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2011-10-08/apple-iphone-pre-orders/50706650/1" target="_blank">announcement</a> of a pre-sale sell out, clearly there are ton of buyers out there.

One thing I can blame on AT&T though is a lack of foresight of proper error messaging.  When you sign in through iTunes, here&#8217;s the error message you get:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840" title="iphone-4S-activation-error-att" src="http://i1.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iphone-4S-activation-error-att.png?fit=872%2C259" alt="" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iphone-4S-activation-error-att.png?w=872 872w, http://i1.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iphone-4S-activation-error-att.png?resize=150%2C44 150w, http://i1.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iphone-4S-activation-error-att.png?resize=300%2C89 300w, http://i1.wp.com/randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iphone-4S-activation-error-att.png?resize=500%2C148 500w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Well, which is it AT&T and Apple?  If my activation is still pending, and you are going to send me an email, why do I need to try again later?  I have to believe that some of the activation server problems stem from not being clear about what to do.  With users (like myself) re-sending the activation over-and-over again, and potentially a script inside of AT&T trying to activate all these iPhones, there&#8217;s got to be a ton of redundant processor cycles being burned.

I&#8217;ve also tried to activate straight from my iPhone via Wi-Fi and over the 3G cell network, and even called AT&T.  Not surprisingly, the customer &#8220;service&#8221; rep at AT&T claimed there&#8217;s no internal report of an activation problem, but I should try iTunes to see if that will activate my phone.

Thanks for nothing.

## Once the Activation Issues disappear&#8230;

Eventually, I&#8217;ll be really happy with my purchase.  Until then, I&#8217;ve got the equivalent of a Christmas present that comes &#8220;Some Assembly Required&#8221; or &#8220;Needs Batteries (not included)&#8221;.  What was the promising start to the weekend with my new iPhone 4S is now just a blackout period, waiting for AT&T to get their shit together.

## Update:  New error message

As if the first confusing error message wasn&#8217;t enough, now AT&T/Apple have switched it to say &#8220;Turn your phone on and off to retry&#8221;.  Wow, the old &#8220;Did you reboot your PC?&#8221; trick!

7 hours in, who knows how many attempts&#8230;no activation.

## Update 2:  iPhone 4S Activation Complete!

After 7 hours of trying, finally I have a working iPhone 4S!
