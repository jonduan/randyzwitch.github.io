The aim of this project is simple: information deserves to be free.

The “analytics” industry is no longer a community of like-minded analysts, sharing techniques and lifting each other up. Now, it’s just vendors and consultants writing advertisements about how they can “help” you (assuming you’re willing to fill out a lead-gen form, for no more details than thinly-veiled sales pitch). Gone are the days where people shared analysis techniques, provided code snippets or even wrote JavaScript plugins and gave them away to the community; now it’s just multi-thousand dollar conferences, where the speakers do nothing more than ape the knowledge that can be learned freely from a Tufte book, or from an (un-sourced) blog post.

All contributions are welcome; everyone knows something that someone else doesn't!
