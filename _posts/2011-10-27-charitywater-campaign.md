But just because I&#8217;m volunteering my time doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t raise some money also.  As we go into the holiday season, I&#8217;ve started a charity:water campaign:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong><a title="charity:water website" href="http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater">100 miles for charity:water.</a></strong>
</p>

Find out about the details at [my fundraising website](http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater "charity:water website").  As the weeks go by, I&#8217;ll be publishing a dashboard of the progress, with pictures of each of my runs for proof.  I&#8217;ll also be including such embarrassing KPI&#8217;s as avg. time per mile, current weight, and anything else I think of.

I&#8217;m already in for 5 miles.  There&#8217;s only 95 to go.

&nbsp;

*Jason is the aspiring web analyst, and I&#8217;m the grizzled veteran.  I think.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update:</span>  After Day 1, already 27% of the way to $1000!  I&#8217;ll start paying off the miles this weekend, but there&#8217;s still plenty more opportunity to contribute.
