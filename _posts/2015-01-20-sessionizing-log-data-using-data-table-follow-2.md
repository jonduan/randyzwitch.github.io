Thanks to userÂ <a title="dnlbrky comment" href="http://randyzwitch.com/sessionizing-log-data-dplyr-r-window-functions/#comment-16205" target="_blank">dnlbrky</a>, we now have a third way to accomplish sessionizing log data for any arbitrary time out period (see methods [1](http://randyzwitch.com/sessionizing-log-data-sql/ "Sessionizing Log Data Using SQL") and [2](http://randyzwitch.com/sessionizing-log-data-dplyr-r-window-functions/ "Sessionizing Log Data Using dplyr [Follow-up]")), this time using data.table from R along with magrittr for piping:



I agree with dnlbrky in that this feels a little better than the dplyr method for heavy SQL users like me, but ultimately, I still think the SQL method is the most elegant and obvious to understand. But that's the great thing with open-source software; pick any tool you want, accomplish whatever you choose using any method you choose.
