So far in the child theme tutorials for the WordPress Twenty Eleven theme, we&#8217;ve created a <a title="Twenty Eleven Child Theme: Creating CSS file" href="http://randyzwitch.com/2011/07/twenty-eleven-child-theme-creating-css-file/" target="_blank">custom CSS</a>Â file and <a title="Twenty Eleven Child Theme:  Custom Header" href="http://randyzwitch.com/2011/07/custom-header-twenty-eleven-child-theme/" target="_blank">custom header</a>. Â Now, let&#8217;s add a custom footer and remove &#8220;Powered by WordPress&#8221;.

<!--more-->

The first step to having a custom footer for your Twenty Eleven child theme is to copy the _footer.phpÂ _file from the parent Twenty Eleven theme into your directory. Â You will find this file on your server here:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  /wp-content/themes/twentyeleven
</p>

Once you have copied this file over to your Twenty Eleven child theme folder (for me the location on my server isÂ /wp-content/themes/twentyeleven-child), you are done! Â You have a custom footer file&#8230;but on your blog, everything will look the same. Â That&#8217;s because while you technically have created a new footer for your blog, no code has actually changed. We&#8217;ll fix that in the next section.

## Powered by WordPress! Â Woo-hoo!

I can&#8217;t fault WordPress for wanting to drive traffic to their website, especially given they provide the Twenty Eleven theme for free. Â But that doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;Powered by WordPress&#8221; in the footer doesn&#8217;t look goofy. Â Luckily, it&#8217;s not too difficult to change.

Open up the <del><em>header.php</em></del>Â _footer.php_ file from your child theme using your favorite text editor. Â In this file, you&#8217;ll find the following code:

All we need to do to remove &#8220;Powered by WordPress&#8221; is to comment out this code using HTML comment tag, like the following:

Once you hit save, you&#8217;re all set. Â No more &#8220;Powered by WordPress&#8221;, no more text at all. Just a blank footer.



## What if I want to put my own links in the footer?

Of course, just because you don&#8217;t want &#8220;Powered by WordPress&#8221; in the footer doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t want any links in the footer. Â If you want to add your own text/links, re-open your _footer.php_ file and place your text in the same location as the code we just commented out.

For example, if I wanted to put &#8220;Â© Randy Zwitch &#8211; 2011&#8221; in the footer, I would place this text between the opening and closing div tags for &#8220;site generator&#8221;:



It&#8217;s as easy as that to have a custom footer message! Â You can get even more tricky by widgets and ads and tag clouds&#8230;but there&#8217;s something to be said for a clean, sleek design. Â So I&#8217;ll stop there ðŸ™‚
