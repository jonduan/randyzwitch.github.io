It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s been over 2.5 years since I wrote about my experience with Apple trying to get my <a title="Apple Has Earned a Customer for Life" href="http://randyzwitch.com/broken-macbook-pro-hinge-fixed-free/" target="_blank">Broken MacBook Pro Hinge</a> fixed. Since that time, my Late 2008 MacBook Pro continued to work flawlessly, most of the time keeping up with the scientific programming I would do in R, Python or Julia.

Unfortunately, it seems near impossible (if not completely impossible) to get an OEM A1281 battery as a drop-in replacement. When I went to the Apple Store at Suburban Square, PA, the &#8220;Genius&#8221; that looked at my computer took 15-20 minutes to look on the Apple website (which I obviously did before arriving, so no value-add there), only to show me a battery in stock that didn&#8217;t fit my model of computer. Only after shaming him into looking up the actual part number, was he able to utter the phrase:

> Oh, no, we don&#8217;t have those any more. Your model MacBook Pro was declared &#8220;Vintage&#8221;. No more original parts are available from Apple.

_Of course_ it is. After getting home, I was able to find this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624" target="_blank">service bulletin</a> from Apple, which outlines which models are obsolete. Apparently, it&#8217;s a hard and fast rule that once five years from the end of manufacturing arrives, a model is declared vintage (unless local laws require longer service). So even though the only &#8220;problem&#8221; with my MacBook Pro is that I was only getting one hour of battery life per charge (or less if I&#8217;m compiling code), the computer is destined for a new life somewhere else.





### &#8220;Vintage&#8221; For Me, Powerful For Thee

While I realize I could go the 3rd-party route and get a replacement battery, at some point, you can only spend so much money keeping older technology alive. Since I use computers pretty intensively, I ended up getting a &#8220;new&#8221; (used) 2011 MacBook Pro from a neighborhood listing that has decent life on the OEM battery. Surprisingly, I was able to get $360 for my Late-2008 MacBook Pro, being fully honest about the condition, issues and battery life. The older woman who I sold it to fully understood, but worked at a desk and didn&#8217;t care about the battery! She also said:

> This is easily the most powerful computer I&#8217;ve ever owned.

Apple, like I said in my original post, you&#8217;ve got a customer for life. And while I&#8217;ve moved on to a newer machine, it&#8217;s beyond amazing to me that a 7-year old computer will continue to live on and work at a high level of performance. And with my 2011 MacBook Pro, I still have the option to upgrade the parts (though I don&#8217;t need to&#8230;SSD, 16GB of RAM and a quad-core i7 processor already!)

The Retina MacBook&#8217;s are nice, but very incremental. Here&#8217;s hoping the 2011 MacBook Pro lasts as long as my Late 2008 MacBook Pro did!
